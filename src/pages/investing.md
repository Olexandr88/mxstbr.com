I irregularly angel invest small checks ($2500-$5000) of my own money in early-stage startups I'm excited about. Think of me as an advisor with skin in the game — I love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to my network and audience, or even just lending an ear to founders building exciting new things.

> Max is one of our highest value-add investors: he constantly gives us good product feedback and knows everything about open source. On top of that, every time he talks about us to his developer audience our stats go wild.

If you're founding a startup and think this could be a good fit I'd love to meet you. [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) or <a href="mailto:contact@mxstbr.com">send me an email</a> and let's chat!

### What I invest in

I invest if I think I can provide value to you, whether through advice, audience, network, credibility or anything else. If I can't help you at all, it probably doesn't make sense for you to take my money.

I love investing in products that I (would) use myself, even more so if they're products aimed at developers.

I love investing early to make the most of the limited amount of money I have. The earlier, the better.

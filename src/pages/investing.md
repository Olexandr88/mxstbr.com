Together with [Sue Odio](https://sueodio.com), we angel invest small ($2.5k - $5k) checks in early-stage startups we're excited about. Think of us as advisors with skin in the game — we love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to our networks and audiences, or even just lending an ear.

> Max is one of our highest value-add investors: he constantly gives us good product feedback and knows everything about open source.
> 
> On top of that, every time he talks about us to his developer audience our stats go wild.

> – Brendan Falk, CEO Fig

If you're founding a startup and think this could be a good fit we'd love to meet you. <a href="mailto:contact@mxstbr.com">Send us an email</a> and let's chat!

### What we invest in

We invest first-and-foremost in the people. Our main filter is "Do we believe these founders can go through the one-of-a-kind challenge of building a company that can change the world?"

We love investing early to make the most of the limited amount of money we have. The earlier, the better.

I personally love investing in products that I (would) use myself, even more so if they're products aimed at developers.

We should ban margin from our components.

Hear me out.

### The problems with using margin in a component

#### 1. Margin breaks component encapsulation

A component should not affect anything outside it's own visual boundaries. Defining margin inside a component adds “invisible” space outside the component's visual boundaries.

#### 2. Margin makes components less reusable

One specific margin around a component cannot be ideal for all instances of the component. Different layouts and contexts require different spacing.

#### 3. Margin conflicts with how designers think

Defining margin in a component defines it globally for all instances of the component. But designers think about space in relation and context: they define how far a component should be from another component _in a specific layout/context_, not globally.

## Use spacers instead

Instead of margin I have started using spacers (either -components or -class names), which **move the responsibility of managing space to the parent-level.**

For example, the Braid design system popularized the idea of a [`Stack` component](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Stack):

```jsx
<Stack space={3}>
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</Stack>
```

TailwindCSS popularized [space between](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space) and [gap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gap) (for flexbox and grid) utility class names:

```jsx
<div className="space-x-3">
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</div>

<div className="gap-3 flex">
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</div>
```

Under the hood, both spacer components and class names still use the `margin` CSS properties with a [lobotomized owl selector](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/) or the `gap` property (for flexbox and grid layouts):

```css
.space-x-3 > * + * {
  margin-top: 0.75rem;
}

.gap-3 {
  gap: 0.75rem;
}
```

### The benefits of spacers

Moving the responsibility of managing space to the parent-level has benefits that aren't obvious.

#### 1. Spacers keep our spacing consistent

Spacers can restrict spacing values to steps on a scale. (e.g., `space-x-3` -> `margin-left: 0.75rem`) That way, all spacing automatically aligns to a grid and is consistent.

#### 2. Spacers force us to build more encapsulated, and thus reusable, components

Spacers define how far a component should be from another component in a specific instance. They force you to define space in relation and context instead of globally for all instances of a component at once.

#### 3. Spacers bring us closer to how designers think

Who else thinks about space in relation and context? Designers.

So: **Use spacers. Ban margin.**

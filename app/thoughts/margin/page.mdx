We should ban margin from our components. Hear me out.

1. Margin breaks component encapsulation. A well-built component should not affect anything outside itself.

2. Margin makes reusability harder. Good components are usable in any context or layout.

3. Margin conflicts with how designers think. Designers think about space in relation and context, they define how far a component should be from another component _in a specific instance._

## Use spacer components or spacer class names

Instead of margin I have started using spacers, either components and class names, which move the responsibility of managing space to the parent-level.

For example, the Braid design system popularized the [`Stack` component](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Stack):

```jsx
<Stack space={3}>
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</Stack>
```

TailwindCSS popularized [space between](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space) and, for flexbox and grid, [gap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gap) utility class names:

```jsx
<div className="space-x-3">
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</div>

<div className="gap-3 flex">
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</div>
```

Under the hood, they still use the `margin` CSS properties with a [lobotomized owl selector](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/) or use the `gap` property with flexbox and grid layouts:

```css
.space-x-3 > * + * {
  margin-top: 0.75rem;
}

.gap-3 {
  gap: 0.75rem;
}
```

### The benefits

Using spacers has implications that are not obvious _a priori_.

#### 1. Spacers keep our user interfaces consistent

Spacers can restrict spacing values to steps on a scale. That way, all spacing automatically aligns to the grid.

#### 2. Spacers force us to build more encapsulated, and thus reusable, components

Spacers define how far a component should be from another component in a specific instance.

They force you to define space in relation and contextâ€”instead of globally for all instances of a component at once.

#### 3. Spacers bring us closer to how designers think

Who else thinks about space in relation and context? Designers.

So: Use spacers. Ban margin.

We should ban margin from our components. Hear me out.

Margin breaks component encapsulation. A well-built component should not affect anything outside itself.

Margin makes reusability harder. Good components are usable in any context or layout.

Margin conflicts with how designers think. Designers think about space in relation and context. They define how far a component should be from another component in a specific instance.

By banning margin from all components you have to build more reusable and encapsulated components.

## Use spacer components or classnames

Instead of margin I have started using spacers, either components and classnames, which move the responsibility of managing space to the parent-level.

For example, the Braid design system popularized the [`Stack` component](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Stack):

```jsx
<Stack space={3}>
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</Stack>
```

TailwindCSS popularized ["space between" utility classnames](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space) for both axis (`x` and `y`):

```jsx
<div className="space-x-3">
  <Item />
  <Item />
  <Item />
</div>
```

Under the hood, they still use the `margin` CSS properties, but apply them with a [lobotomized owl selector](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/):

```css
.space-x-3 > * + * {
  margin-top: 0.75rem;
}
```

### The benefits

Using spacers has implications that are not obvious _a priori_.

Spacers can restrict spacing values to steps on a scale. That way, all spacing automatically aligns to the grid.

Spacers define how far a component should be from another component in a specific instance. They force you to define space in relation and context, instead of globally for all instances of a component at once.

Who else thinks about space in relation and context? Designers.

So, spacers bring us closer to how designers think. They make our designs more consistent and they force us to build more reusable and encapsulated components.

Use spacers. Ban margin.

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) is an atomic CSS framework that has taken the frontend world by storm. It gives developers without a deep understanding of design the ability to build visually gorgeous, modern user interfaces.

If you have not seen it before, here is the canonical Tailwind example from their original homepage:

```html
<div class="shadow-lg flex bg-white rounded-lg p-6 leading-normal">
  <img class="h-24 w-24 rounded-full mx-0 mr-6" src="avatar.jpg" />
  <div class="text-left">
    <h1 class="text-lg">Erin Lindford</h1>
    <h2 class="text-purple-500">Customer Support</h2>
    <p class="text-slate-600">erinlindford@example.com</p>
    <p class="text-slate-600">(555) 765-4321</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

<div
  className="shadow-lg flex bg-white rounded-lg p-6 leading-normal"
  style={{ fontFamily: 'sans-serif', wordBreak: 'break-all' }}
>
  <img
    alt="Avatar of Erin Lindford"
    className="h-24 w-24 rounded-full mx-0 m-0 mr-6"
    src="https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/17.jpg"
  />
  <div className="text-left">
    <div className="text-lg">Erin Lindford</div>
    <div className="text-purple-500">Customer Support</div>
    <div className="text-slate-600">erinlindford@example.com</div>
    <div className="text-slate-600">(555) 765-4321</div>
  </div>
</div>

Many people think Tailwind is cool because it uses atomic CSS. Here is the thing though: **Tailwind is awesome _despite_ using atomic CSS, not because of it**.

Hear me out.

## The key to Tailwind

We have had [atomic](https://github.com/basscss/basscss/commit/ed65eec980c4899d930f2c293f70bc619573456f) [CSS](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/commit/7f27af8d52d8ed03615e23a9db5ff33fc8153729) [frameworks](https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/introducing-solid-1c16b1bf4868) for almost a decade but none of them have been as critically acclaimed as Tailwind. What makes it different?

**The key to Tailwind's popularity is the painstakingly constructed system of design tokens at the core of the framework.** The system's carefully selected constraints give developers _just_ the right guardrails. They make it obvious whether a choice is good or bad by offering only discrete steps.

This does require some design _taste_, but most frontend engineers I know have developed that over the years of building user interfaces. Tailwind's system lets them turn that taste into implementation without requiring a lot of design _skill_ — it helps them cross ["the gap"](https://vimeo.com/85040589).

Tailwind's system is a masterpiece of design. I, and many other developers all around the world, feel empowered by and love it.

## The problem with Tailwind

The atomic CSS framework is basically a delivery mechanism that allows developers to apply the system to their UIs. It's undeniable that it has a fantastic developer experience: once you get used to the custom vocabulary you feel like you are flying!

However, we have learned over the past decade that [atomic CSS has downsides](https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/):

- Users still have to add a separate setup for the [custom CSS they inevitably need](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1240868842361913347) (coined ["bailwind"](https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1251637275412357121)). You cannot get by on _just_ Tailwind in the real world. Not having a dedicated place for custom styles in the same system can cause maintenance issues down the line.
- Due to file-size considerations, [Tailwind does not include all variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#default-variants-reference) (e.g. `hover:`, `sm:`) for all utilities by default. It leaves it to you to manually configure which ones you need for every single CSS property.
- Atomic CSS is not ideal for performance. No tooling can extract the _per-page_ critical CSS, so you end up shipping more CSS to the browser than necessary. The bigger and more dynamic the app, the more unnecessary code you will ship.[^1]

## Tailwind without the downsides

Brent Jackson, the creator of one of the original atomic CSS libraries, said it best in [his post on atomic CSS](https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/):

> “This methodology was created before React was released and was intended for use in template-based user interfaces, including Rails and PHP. It was never designed for functional component-based UI and doesn't take advantage of this new paradigm.”

Now, here is the thing: you can have your cake and eat it too. You can use Tailwind's marvelous system and fantastic developer experience without the downsides of atomic CSS.

How? [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro).

Let me illustrate. Here is the canonical Tailwind example built with [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) and React:

```jsx
import 'twin.macro'

const Card = () => (
  <div tw="shadow-lg md:flex bg-white rounded-lg p-6 leading-normal">
    <img
      tw="h-16 w-16 md:h-24 md:w-24 rounded-full mx-auto md:mx-0 md:mr-6"
      src="avatar.jpg"
    />
    <div tw="text-center md:text-left">
      <h1 tw="text-lg">Erin Lindford</h1>
      <h2 tw="text-purple-500">Customer Support</h2>
      <p tw="text-slate-600">erinlindford@example.com</p>
      <p tw="text-slate-600">(555) 765-4321</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

<div
  className="shadow-lg flex bg-white rounded-lg p-6 leading-normal"
  style={{ fontFamily: 'sans-serif', wordBreak: 'break-all' }}
>
  <img
    alt="Avatar of Erin Lindford"
    className="h-24 w-24 rounded-full mx-0 m-0 mr-6"
    src="https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/17.jpg"
  />
  <div className="text-left">
    <div className="text-lg">Erin Lindford</div>
    <div className="text-purple-500">Customer Support</div>
    <div className="text-slate-600">erinlindford@example.com</div>
    <div className="text-slate-600">(555) 765-4321</div>
  </div>
</div>

<br />

Unsurprisingly, the result looks identical — we are still using the same system after all. Even the code looks the same, except that we use the `tw` prop instead of the `class` attribute!

However, under the hood this automatically compiles the class names to the actual CSS they refer to (with [the css prop](https://medium.com/styled-components/announcing-native-support-for-the-css-prop-in-styled-components-245ca5252feb)):

```jsx
import 'twin.macro'

;<div tw="text-center md:text-left" />

// ↓↓↓↓↓ turns into ↓↓↓↓↓

import 'styled-components/macro'

;<div
  css={{
    textAlign: 'center',
    '@media (min-width: 768px)': {
      textAlign: 'left',
    },
  }}
/>
```

You get to use Tailwind's system and developer experience _and_ take advantage of [all the benefits of CSS-in-JS](/thoughts/css-in-js):

- Extending your elements with custom styles is as simple as using the css prop, no extra separate setup required to "bailwind":

  ```jsx
  import "twin.macro"

  <div
    tw="text-center md:text-left"
    css={{`
      &:hover {
        background-image: url("/bg.png");
      }
    `}}
  />
  ```

- You can use all variants in all combinations with all utilities allowing for even more expression within the system. Since twin.macro runs at build-time, you don't have to worry about configuration or file size:

  ```jsx
  import 'twin.macro'

  ;<div tw="sm:hover:first:bg-black">...</div>
  ```

- You get fully automatic critical CSS extraction and code splitting. Users will only load exactly the styles they need for the page they requested — nothing more and nothing less! CSS performance does not get better.[^1]

The ideal setup for both developer _and_ user experience!

      to leverage Tailwind's marvelous system and developer experience without

  }

Rather than taking two steps forward with Tailwind's system and one step backward with atomic CSS, let's take five steps forward. Together.

[^1]: CSS-in-JS automatically extracts the critical CSS for the requested page and inlines it into a `<style>` tag. That means the first-paint with CSS-in-JS will _always_ be faster as it saves both an extra network request for the `.css` file as well as sending less CSS code to the client. While the Time To Interactive for small apps will be slightly slower (as the JavaScript bundle includes the CSS-in-JS library you use) once your app grows the network request for the larger CSS file can outweigh any CSS-in-JS library and can cause a slower Time To Interactive as well.&nbsp;

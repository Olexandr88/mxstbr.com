Developer tools are different compared to tools for other professions in one very important way:

**The same people that build the tools are the people that use the tools.**

This is not true for almost all other professions, in tech and especially outside of tech.

For example, bakers will rarely invent a novel oven because building a commercial-grade oven is a totally different skill set than making bread.

Even professions where people do regularly build their own tools can't really bring them to the rest of the world easily. For example, blacksmiths often make their own hammers and anvils.

But how does a blacksmith go from making a better hammer to distributing that hammer to lots of other people? That takes a lot of work, as well as an additional skill set of building a product business.

## Dev tools are different

We **developers build our own ‚Äúcommercial-grade‚Äù tools every day.** It‚Äôs a routine part of our craft to be tackling a task and build a shared abstraction to simplify our work. On top of that, **sharing one of these abstractions with _the entire world_ is as simple as `git push`! ü§Ø**

That is different than any other profession I know of, and has some big implications for trying to build a business selling tools to developers.

## What this means for building a dev tools startup

### Build vs. Buy is a huge hurdle

Whenever we at [Stellate](https://stellate.co) meet an organization that needs our GraphQL edge caching, their developers inevitably ask, ‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt we just build this?‚Äù

That's a really good question. Truthfully, they could! Technically, we build our tools the same way that they build their software, so there's technically nothing stopping them from building their own solution. (outside of any experience and expertise our team has that their team doesn't)

### There will always be a free, open-source version

On top of that, individual developers have strong personal incentives to open source solutions to common problems. If one of their open source solutions becomes popular it can really accelerate their career. (in fact, [that's what my career is based on](https://mxs.is/doc)!)

So, if you ship a novel, good solution to a problem, it will almost certainly be copied in the open source world‚Äînot out of malice, but because of the incentives.

### Dev tools have to be great

These two implications combined mean that in order to build a business in dev tools, you have to build something extremely good.

You have to spend _years_ making it the best version of a solution. That‚Äôs the only way other developers will look at your solution and will go, "Actually, building this is going to take me too long and the open source version isn‚Äôt nearly as good, so I will buy your product instead." Otherwise, if they can copy your abstraction in a few hours or days, they will.

Let me share a few examples from [my own angel investing portfolio](/investments) (which is dev tools-heavy given my background and expertise).
What all these stories have in common is that the most promising dev tools companies look like overnight successes, but were all years in the making:

#### 1. [Zed](https://zed.dev)

The Atom team spent years trying to build the best code editor (going as far as inventing Electron!), and then started a new company from scratch in Rust with all their learnings to make Zed.

Now, years later, it‚Äôs taking off.

#### 2. [Clerk](https://clerk.dev)

This team had to battle building a user management solution that covers every possible authentication use case and yet is easy to use with any front-end framework and secure.

Now, years later, it's taking off.

#### 3. [Incident.io](https://incident.io)

This team's job at Monzo was to build incident tooling to support the level of scale and reliability that being one of the fastest-growing digital-first banks requires. They left Monzo with all those learnings and started building the product that they had always wanted.

Now, years later, it's taking off.

### Everything changes all the time

Finally, we are an ecosystem of inventors that can share new ideas with everybody else in a second. Thus unsurprisingly, new frameworks, libraries, and packages are invented that change the way we work (usually for the better!) all the time.

In order to sustain a business selling to developers, you need to invest serious resources into just ‚Äúkeeping up with the times,‚Äù supporting the latest JavaScript framework du jour that has reinvented how to build components yet again.

---

So, in order to "win" in dev tools, it's not enough to be good. It's not even enough to be great. You have to be great, and then keep being great for a loooong time.

And that's really hard.

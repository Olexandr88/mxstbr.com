Developer tools are different compared to tools for other professions in one very important way:

**The same people that build the tools are the people that use the tools.**

This is not true for almost all other professions, in tech and especially outside of tech.

For example, bakers will rarely reinvent ovens because building a commercial-grade oven is a totally different skill set than making bread. Even professions where people do regularly build their own tools can't really bring them to the rest of the world easily. For example, blacksmiths often make their own hammers and anvils.

But how does a blacksmith go from making a better hammer to distributing that hammer to lots of other people? That takes a lot of work, as well as an additional skill set of building a product business.

## Dev tools are different

We **developers build our own ‚Äúcommercial-grade‚Äù tools every day.** It‚Äôs a routine part of our craft to be tackling a task and build a shared abstraction to simplify our work. On top of that, **sharing one of these abstractions with _the entire world_ is as simple as `git push`! ü§Ø**

That is different than any other profession I know of, and has some big implications for trying to build a business selling tools to developers.

## What this means for building a dev tools startup

### Build vs. buy is a huge hurdle

Whenever we at [Stellate](https://stellate.co) meet an organization that needs our GraphQL edge caching, their developers inevitably ask, ‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt we just build this?‚Äù

That's a really good question. Truthfully, they could! We build our tools the same way that they build their software, so there's technically nothing stopping them from building their own solution.[^1]

### There will be free, open-source copies

Individual developers have a strong personal incentive to open source solutions to common problems: if one of their inventions becomes popular it can really accelerate their career. ([that's what my career is based on](https://mxs.is/doc)!)

So, if you ship an interesting and solution to an important problem, it will almost certainly be copied in the open source world‚Äînot out of malice, but because individual developers are incentivized to do so.[^2]

### The quality bar is high

These two implications combined mean that if your solution isn't 10x better, developers will either use the free, open source version or build it themselves‚Äîeven if that means it'll be a slightly worse solution.

However, "10x better" doesn't necessarily mean you have to spend years building the highest-quality version of a solution. It can also be 10x better because you, for example, understand the problem 10x better. But it has to be 10x better in some way that matters.

### Everything changes all the time

Finally, we are an ecosystem of inventors that can share new ideas with everybody else in a second. Thus unsurprisingly, new frameworks, libraries, and packages are invented that change the way we work all the time (usually for the better!).

In order to sustain a business selling to developers, you need to invest serious resources into just ‚Äúkeeping up with the times,‚Äù supporting the latest JavaScript framework du jour that has reinvented how to build components yet again.

So, it's not enough to build something that's 10x better. You have to build something that's 10x better, and then keep reinventing your your solution to keep being 10x better in a constantly changing ecosystem.

The former is really hard.

The latter? Almost impossible.

_This essay was prompted by [a recent Twitter conversation with Gergely Orosz](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1789916004488757399)._

[^1]: The argument for Buy over Build in enterprise sales conversations almost always boils down to "We have spent years building the most advanced version of this that covers your unique use case perfectly" combined with "Our team has unique experience, expertise, and learnings that would be time consuming for you to acquire."
[^2]: A big blindspot of individual developers that don't work at one is "the enterprise," which I think is a part of the reason why we see so many dev tools startups target "the enterprise": individual developers don't have good visibility into what it takes to solve a problem at an enterprise.

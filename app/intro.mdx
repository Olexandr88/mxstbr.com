**Hi, I'm Max ğŸ‘‹**

I'm the co-founder ofÂ [Stellate](https://stellate.co/), the GraphQL CDN formerly known as GraphCDN. About 1% of all public, crawlable websites use open source tooling I co-created, styled-components.Â I alsoÂ [angel invest](https://mxstbr.com/investing)Â in early-stage startups that I'm passionate about.

Previously, I worked on R&D around visual editing for React & GraphQL apps atÂ [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/)Â and real-time messaging atÂ [GitHub](https://github.com/)Â after they acquired my startupÂ [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/), the community platform of the future.

I'm likely [brewing speciality coffee on my espresso machine](https://github.com/mxstbr/ama/issues/46) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19kDOIwzTfE">skiing around the world</a>.
